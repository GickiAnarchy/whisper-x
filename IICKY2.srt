1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:35,758
All of the little things you do Have me falling hard for you If only you knew You tell me that it feels the same Then we go our separate ways I still feel you

2
00:00:40,277 --> 00:01:01,283
It still plays inside my head If only you care And if you see me in your dreams Can you tell me what it means?

3
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:09,694
Am I still there?

4
00:01:14,804 --> 00:01:39,057
In the space between my ribcage There's a burden at my soul If I could keep you I swear that I would, oh How I wish you knew But you have to go

5
00:01:41,769 --> 00:02:10,495
All of the little things you do Had me pushing away from you If only you knew You tell me that it feels the same That you're sick of the same day I still feel you Maybe in another life

6
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:30,656
When you weren't so close to right We could've made it work And if I see you in my dreams Can you tell me what it means?

7
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:37,163
Are you still hurt?

8
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:38,844
If I could keep

9
00:02:39,532 --> 00:03:08,189
You know that I would In the space inside my chest I've tried my goddamn best If I could keep you I swear that I would Oh, how I wish you knew But you had to go
